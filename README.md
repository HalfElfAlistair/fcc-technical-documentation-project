## Introduction

Made as part of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Meet the 15 user stories in [the brief](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page).

- User Story 1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

- User Story 2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.

- User Story 3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

- User Story 4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

- User Story 5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

- User Story 6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

- User Story 7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

- User Story 8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

- User Story 9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

- User Story 10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

- User Story 11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

- User Story 12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").

- User Story 13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

- User Story 14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

- User Story 15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.


### Personal Aims

Test out some of my understanding of Google Analytics and producing a page that is educational and relatively easy to understand.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- codepen.io/FCC: Test Suite Template

I used VSC and Chrome Devtools to compile my code. Then copied the <body> and CSS into the codepen test suite.

## Acknowledgments

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
The educational and practical opportunity to develop my coding skills.

### [WebAIM.org](https://webaim.org/)
Their colour contrast checker is a go to for me every time so I can ensure my work is readable.

### [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/)
I use their 'create a palette' tool to help me select a colour scheme.

### [Awesome Screenshot & Screen Recorder]](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/)
This plugin was really helpful for me to obtain images for my technical documentation page.

### [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web)
An excellent and important tool that provided the inspiration for my page content.


## Author Notes

If I'm honest I should've read the brief more clearly before embarking on this project. I didn't initially realise I needed to use the code element for this. Rather than starting again from scratch, I kind of forced some code samples into the project. This was easy enough when explaining how to get started with Google Analytics as you need the JavaScript tracking code. I was still short on the minimum 5 code element limit though so added something about hreflang on international sites. So a bit of a blag at times but the content isn't the point to the project so it matters not.

The appearance on this project isn't up to much in my opinion. A lot of examples were pretty plain 'black text on white background' so I decided to go for the opposite. I thought a little bit of colour thrown in for headings too, though I'm not sure it worked. Provided it all passes contrast checks and is readable then it's not a major issue as this isn't the type of page that's super important for a marketing process or anything.
