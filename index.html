                </header>
                <p>Before you can collect all of the useful data that Google Analytics presents, you'll need to set up an account and implement the necessary tracking code.<br><br>To get set up, you can use a Google account or make one (if you don't already have one).<br><br>You can then go to Google Analytics and log in using the aforementioned account, sign up and fill in your website information.<br><br>You'll need to aquire your tracking code by clicking 'Get tracking ID'.<br><br>The code uses JavaScript and looks similar to this:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];<br>function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}<br>gtag('js', new Date());<br><br>gtag('config', 'UA-179006172-1');</code>
                </div>
                <p>Insert your code into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your HTML, on each page, like so:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-54516992-1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>&lt;script&gt;<br>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];<br>function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}<br>gtag('js', new Date());<br><br>gtag('config', 'UA-54516992-1');<br>&lt;/script&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;</code>

                </header>
                <p>The first option on the list is the Overview tab.<br><br>This compares basic data for the site. Selecting Bounce Rate from the dropdown will give you a brief idea of how it's performing.</p>

                <p>Before we get into the specific segmenting options you can see data for, it's important to establish how to view it to meet your needs.<br><br>There are different ways to compare bounce rate across your website.<br><br>A simple option is to look at the bounce rate column when viewing a specific audience report. This will give you an idea of how different factors compare with each other and against your site average.</p>

                <p>For a more detailed analysis it's good to assess your bounce rate against the industry average.<br><br>To do this, click on the comparison filter button and then, once the window has loaded, select bounce rate from the dropdown.<br><br>The negative figures, to the left of the industry average line, are the ones performing better. Those to the right, with red coloured bars, are the ones you may want to improve.</p>

                </header>
                <p>The following segments are really useful for analysing bounce rate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Demographics</li>
                    <li>Technology</li>

                <p>In this section you're able to compare bounce rate by age or gender.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Age</h3>
                    <p>Look at the bounce rate column and check if there are any patterns or stand out issues.<br><br>For example, if you're targeting young people as a market and notice bounce rate is particularly high amongst 18-24 year olds, you'll want to investigate further and improve that.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                <h3>Gender</h3>
                <p>Similarly to age, you can currently view a bounce rate comparison between two genders, male & female.<br><br>So again if there's a notable discrepancy that conflicts with your target audience, it'll be important to re-assess what you're doing.<br><br>Alternatively, if gender isn't a metric you target, but there's a big difference, you'll want to make sure you aren't deterring people with how you present your product.</p>

                <p>Making sure your site works across browsers, versions and operating systems is important.<br><br>You can use the Broser & OS view to compare bounce rate for various spec.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>You can also look at bounce rate by language or geographic location. This is important for multi-national businesses or those in countries like Canada where different languages are regionally prevalent.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Location</h3>
                    <p>Setting location gives you the option of a country, city, continent or sub-continent view.<br><br>If bounce rate is notably better in the US than UK then you'll want to investigate how your site and market differ on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

                    <p>You might find you need to improve the French version of your site if it performs particularly badly on bounce rate, for example.</p>

                    <p>For a site with different language versions make sure you're using <code>hreflang</code> attribute set to both language and country. For example, a US, English language version would need this:</p>
